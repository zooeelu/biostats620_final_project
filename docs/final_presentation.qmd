## Introduction

## Patterns in Data {.smaller}

:::

-   Population Composition: From 1985 to 2022, population becoming progressively older

-   Mortality Rates: Decrease in overall mortality rates in the aggregate population over time

    -   Could help to explain why we see increased population sizes for older age groups

    -   Healthier lifestyles, improvements in medical care access and quality

## Expected Mortality {.smaller}

#### Linear Model: $Y_{i}$ \~ N($\mu$, $\sigma^2$), $Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{0}$ + $\beta_{1}$$Population_{i}$ + $\beta^{Week}_{2}$ + $\beta^{Age}_{3}$ + $\beta^{Sex}_{4}$ + $\epsilon_{i}$

-   Goal: predict mortality rate to see if observed mortality is higher or lower than expected

![](figs/QQ.png)
:::

-   Normality and Constant Variance clearly violated, model may not be good to use for predicting

-   8% of fitted values negative for strictly positive outcome (rate)

-   T-tests show that week, age group, and gender were all significantly associated with weekly mortality rate.

## Generalized Linear Models

#### Log-linear Model: $Y_{i}$ \~ Poi($\lambda$), $Y_{i}$ = $\beta_{0}$ + $\beta_{1}$$Population_{i}$ + $\beta^{Week}_{2}$ + $\beta^{Age}_{3}$ + $\beta^{Sex}_{4}$ + $\epsilon_{i}$

-   Goal: predict weekly mortality rate, this time modeling total deaths and using an offset equal to population size for a given week, gender, age, and year.

## Periods with Excess Mortality Before 2017

## Excess Mortality: 2017-2018
